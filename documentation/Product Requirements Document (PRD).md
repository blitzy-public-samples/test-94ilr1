# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the comprehensive requirements for developing an AI-powered email management platform. The document serves as a reference for stakeholders including developers, project managers, QA engineers, and business analysts involved in the development process. It provides detailed specifications, functional requirements, and technical constraints necessary for successful implementation.

## 1.2 Scope
The email management platform aims to revolutionize how professionals handle their work email communications through intelligent tracking and automated responses. The system will:

- Track and analyze incoming/outgoing work emails
- Build contextual understanding of ongoing projects and communications
- Generate appropriate automated responses based on historical context
- Maintain conversation history and relationship mapping
- Provide intelligent email organization and categorization
- Ensure secure handling of sensitive email data
- Integrate with common email service providers

Key benefits include:
- Reduced response time for routine inquiries
- Improved email organization and searchability
- Enhanced productivity through automated response handling
- Better context retention across long-term communications
- Decreased cognitive load in managing multiple email threads

The platform will focus specifically on professional/work email management and will not handle personal email accounts or non-email communications.
